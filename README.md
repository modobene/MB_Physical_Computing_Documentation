Welcome to my Physical Computing documentation :-)

As you can see, I made a folder for each individual exercise. You will find the corresponding code, images, and schematics there. Please consult the READMEs in each folder for easier image viewing.
For chronology's sake, I used the YY/MM/DD format in my folder structure.
